# Workshop on Crystallising Liquid Core of the Earth
### Edinburgh - April 8th and 9th

* * *

This workshop delves into the critical role of Earth’s core in driving planetary processes, including generating magnetic fields through the geodynamo and influencing tectonic activity. We will explore the crystallization and demixing of Fe-Si-O liquids, key to understanding the core’s composition, evolution, and dynamics. High-pressure, high-temperature experiments and calculations inform models which examine how light elements like silicon and oxygen affect the core’s cooling, chemical differentiation, and magnetic field history. With these tools we will illuminate the core’s formation, its influence on mantle convection, and its fundamental role in shaping Earth’s environment and sustaining life.
