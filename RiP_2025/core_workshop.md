# Workshop on Crystallising Liquid Core of the Earth
### Edinburgh - April 8th and 9th

* * *

This workshop delves into the critical role of Earth’s core in driving planetary processes, including generating magnetic fields through the geodynamo and influencing tectonic activity. We will explore the crystallization and/or demixing of Fe-alloy liquids, how they would power the geodynamo, and what palaeomagnetic evidence would tell us about it. As such the workshop aims to bring researchers in different fields together and make multidisciplinary discussions on the core processes to understand where we stand. With this unique opportunity, we will illuminate how the Earth generates magnetic fields and its fundamental role in shaping the planet’s environment and sustaining life.
